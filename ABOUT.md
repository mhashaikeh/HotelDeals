#Used Technologies:
1- Java8 as a programming language.
2- Spring MVC and a framework.
3- JACKSON for parsing the JSON.
4- HTML5, HTML, CSS, Javascript for the UI displaying and handling.
5- LOG4J for the logging prints.

#Why Java:
Java is the most portable programming language, Strong and rich with components and features.
Java is more secure and solid of handing the processes and given the flexibility to handle the cases clearly.
Also most of my eleven years experience is on java.

#Why Spring MVC:
Spring MVC is providing very clean division between controllers, Java Beans views.
Spring MVC is providing well annotations so code will be more clear, understandable and shorter.
Spring MVC is more testable so validations is not dependent on Servlet API, So problem solving is more easy.

#Why JACKSON:
JACKSON provides annotations.
JACKSON converting the JSON to entity beans, so making the interaction with the data more easy.
JACKSON easy to use and easy to test, and clearly describes the parsing faults.
